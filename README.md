Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript my task was to create a web browser game. In my case I chose to create a "Guess the Word" game (formely known s Hangman). When deciding on the topic in which my word bank would consist of, I picked space related terms because it's one of my favorite topics.

Getting Started: 
To actually play the game follow this link to the webpage: [Link to game](https://diegoruiz06.github.io/First-Project/)

The rules are quite easy, simple press any letter key on your keyboard to being guessing. If you guess correctly the letter will appear in the corresponding blank. However, if you guess wrong the game will put that letter in a "discard pile" at the bottom. You have a total of 10 guesses per round; if you are able to guess the word withtin those 10 tries you earn a point in the "Wins" section. If you don't then a point is given to the "Losses" section.
